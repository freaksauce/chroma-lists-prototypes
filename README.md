# Chroma Lists Prototypes

The idea of this repo is a complete overhaul of the current Chroma List implementations to allow for a more composable set of List components that enable greater flexibility for the design system.

Once these components have been finalised the .scss will be merged into chroma-core and the react components will be merged into chroma-react and the old list types (List, DetailList, ActionList) will be deprecated from chroma-react.

This will be a major breaking change to the current system, new documentation will need to be written and developers advised if they want to upgrade what the changes mean.
